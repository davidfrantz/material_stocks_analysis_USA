# Analysis of CONUS material stocks

Humanity’s role in changing the face of the earth is a long-standing concern, as is the human domination of ecosystems.
Geologists are debating the introduction of a new geological epoch, the ‘anthropocene’, as humans are ‘overwhelming the great forces of nature’.
In this context, the accumulation of artifacts, i.e., human-made physical objects, is a pervasive phenomenon. 
Variously dubbed ‘manufactured capital’, ‘technomass’, ‘human-made mass’, ‘in-use stocks’ or ‘socioeconomic material stocks’, 
they have become a major focus of sustainability sciences in the last decade. 
Globally, the mass of socioeconomic material stocks now exceeds 10e14 kg, which is roughly equal to the dry-matter equivalent of all biomass on earth. 
It is doubling roughly every 20 years, almost perfectly in line with ‘real’ (i.e. inflation-adjusted) GDP. 
In terms of mass, buildings and infrastructures (here collectively called ‘built structures’) represent the overwhelming majority of 
all socioeconomic material stocks.
